Download the Datasets and then organize it myself. 

Huggingface Version CSTR:

DAPS has a clean version and an enhanced version

Go with ContectVec for now.

Figuring out GPU is the next thing on my todo list. 

Try to figure out what is going on with the two clusters in Resemblyzer.

Getting more than 2 speakers might push the two clusters together

Might need to train my own model to combine the resemblyzer with the contentvec. 

Architecture would be similar to GR0 or AutoVC.


Note: On October 21 I found a comment that remade content vec as a huggingface page:
