Can get on the princeton file system:
ssh portal.cs.princeton.edu
(doesn't work but can try portal.cs.princeton.edu or courselab.cs.princeton.edu)

large scratch file system: /n/fs/scratch
so you can do:
cs /n/fs/scratch

mkdir se2375
cd se2375

curl or wget to get the huge files and then unzip them there.

when you put files there, they get removed after two weeks.
